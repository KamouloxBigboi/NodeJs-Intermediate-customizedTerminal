For this project, you will see more modules of NodeJS

0. Clone the repo then generate a `package.json` using the command `npm init` ; create an empty `index.js`, and make it print "Node rocks!" in the console when running `node index.js`

1. Write a function that display the date and the time. The time should refresh automatically every second. By now you should know how to create an action that repeats at regular intervals...!.

2. Write a function to track how much memory the system is currently using. It will display the % of memory currently used, out of the total system memory. You will need the module [OS](https://nodejs.org/api/os.html) 
The data will be printed in green if memory usage is decreasing; in red if it's increasing.
The time interval to refresh the data is up to you, pick something that makes sense!

3. Write a function that displays the exchange rate of the BTC. It will prompt the user for the currency to display the exchange rate in..
The look & feel (color? ASCII art or icons?) is up to you !

4. Add another option to require at least one symbol and/or one number in the generated password.
